Congratulations! You are now an owner of some DiddyCoin.
DiddyCoin's worth scales with how much of it is in circulation.
Only 10,000 DDY exists and more cannot be created, only deleted. 
  
The initial value of 10,000 DDYis $100,000,000 backed by Wolf and sweup. This is the market cap.

You can calculate the worth of your DiddyCoin as follows:
(market cap / amount of DDY in circ.) * amount of DDY

For example, when DiddyCoin was first started:
(100,000,000 / 10,000) = $10,000 per DDY

You can exchange DDY for OB money by DMing @sweup on DC. 

Exchanging DDY to $ costs a tiny fee, destroys the DDY in the process, and removes that money from the market cap.
This makes the value of DiddyCoin more volatile. Doing this exchange changes the previous calculation in a linear way that makes future changes to the market more impactful.
Moreover this creates a "Buy low, sell high" market and means you can get insanely rich lmao

You can also put money into DiddyCoin's market cap. This increases the value of each coin by a not insignificant amount.
DM sweup for more info.
